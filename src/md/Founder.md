Hi, I am Evelyn, home baker, designer , instructor and founder of Petalimn. I am from Taiwan, stayed in Beijing for several years, now living in Laguna Niguel. We are loving SoCal living.

I used to be a website designer. I am interested in Chinese traditional culture since I moved to Beijing. I loved and still have passion for digital design and I wanted to put that passion and drive into a new business - Cake decorating. Bringing my designer background and the experience of Chinese brush painting and oil painting into culinary artistry makes my cakes one of a kind. I am always keeping my work practical, relevant and creative.

One of my favorite things about being a instructor of cake decorating is getting to learn from my students, their occupations and their stories, that is really inspired me a lot. The most important thing to learn flower pip is“ there is no established rules in piping flowers, just pip with your rhythm”. Let's forget about any techniques and just have some fun in the class.

Thank you for taking time to get to know me a little better and I hope that I have the pleasure of having classes with you in the future. For more information about classes, portfolio or how we can collaborate on an upcoming project, just feel free to contact me .
